With combining your theme with random keywords, you might be inspired and able to generate some good ideas. Once you got good ideas, keep it so that you can see it whenever you want.

## Customize built-in keywords

Built-in keywords are managed as a json file. You can edit this file and change keywords as you like. Categories can be edited too.

This software uses SharedPreferences as data storage so if you have used this software before, you might need to clear all data at first.

```
[root]/assets/keyword.json
[root]/assets/category.json
```
